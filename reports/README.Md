# Report Folder

This folder is used for documents (i.e. Rmd) and code concretely related to your project. Please create **subdirectories for your country** using [ISO 3166 ALPHA-3](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-3166-1-Kodierliste) (e.g. `reports/AUT`).

Have a look at `_template` for a quick demonstration of Rmarkdown.
